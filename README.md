# NotesApp Frontend

This is the frontend application for the NotesApp, built using React and Vite. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing notes, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. The application interacts with the backend API to perform these operations.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Add new notes with a title and content.
- **Read Notes**: View all notes or a specific note by ID.
- **Update Notes**: Modify existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes by ID.
- **Search Notes**: Search notes by keyword.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/notesapp.git
   cd notesapp/frontend



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
